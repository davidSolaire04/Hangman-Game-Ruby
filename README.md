# Hangman-Game-Ruby
Hangman Game

Created the game of Hangman using Ruby programming language.
The repository contains four files:
  app.rb
  gameinterface.rb
  hangman.rb
  wordlist.txt
  
Run the app.rb to start the game of Hangman.

The app.rb file requires the gameinterface.rb and hangman.rb files and starts the game.
The gameinterface.rb provides a user interface to run the game and the hangman.rb
provides the logic. The hangman.rb reads the wordlist.txt to read in the words to use, however, if it cannot
find the wordlist.txt file, then, it uses default wordlist from the hangman.rb file.
The hangman.rb reads each line from the text file.
